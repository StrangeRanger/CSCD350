Test A.1: Basic Actuator Creation
	1. This test is to verify that the ActuatorParser is properly parsing the command and creating an actuator. This will help us in assuring that the actuator is created and actually has the correct parameters.
	2. There is no Actuator created and no other objects should affect the creation of a new actuator.
