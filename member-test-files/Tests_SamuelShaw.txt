Test A.1: Basic Actuator Creation
	1. This test is to verify that the ActuatorParser is properly parsing the command and creating an actuator. This will help us in assuring that the actuator is created and actually has the correct parameters.
	2. There is no Actuator created and no other objects should affect the creation of a new actuator.
	3.	"CREATE ACTUATOR LINEAR a1 ACCELERATION LEADIN 0.1 LEADOUT -0.2 RELAX 0.3 VELOCITY LIMIT 5 VALUE MIN 1 MAX 20 INITIAL 2 JERK LIMIT 3"		System.out.println(startup._parserHelper.getSymbolTableActuator().toString());
	4. There should be a string output to the console that shows that the properties of the actuator have been properly set.
	5. SymbolTable{size=1 map={Identifier{name=myactuator1}=ActuatorPrototype{id=myactuator1 groups=[3,actuator,all] controller=<none> sensors=[] value=2.0 valueSource=2.0 valueTarget=2.0 valueMin=1.0 valueMax=20.0 acceleration=0.0 accelerationLeadin=0.1 accelerationLeadout=-0.2 accelerationRelax=0.3 velocity=0.0 velocityLimit=5.0 inflectionJerkThreshold=3.0}}}
	6. The actual output of this test prints out the contents of the Actuator SymbolTable. While this does prove that the actuator has been created, it also contains other information not needed for this test.
	7. Include a previously created sensor in the creation of the actuator.
